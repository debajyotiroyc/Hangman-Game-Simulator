# Hangman-Game-Simulator
Using python I have developed the hangman game (word guessing game).

The rules are simple: computer will think of a word and you will have to figure it out by guessing the presence of a character one at a time.

You will have 7 tries i.e., before the man is hanged.

If the man is hanged before you can guess correctly , you lose. If you guess correctly you win.

Go through the program to learn more.

Enjoy!!!!
